<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
<p>Copyright is a law that gives the owner of their content the right to say if or how someone can use their content, mostly someone can only use someone else's content with permission. This can affect websites because it restricts what you can put on your website without permission, if you want to put something on your website that has been created by someone else you will have to get their permission to use it. If you do not gain permission for someone's content they can take legal action against you for using their content when they didnt want you to or they didn't give you permission to use it.

<h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them</h3>
<p>People can be color blind or have low vision and this can affect how or what they can see on the website and make the website hard to use for them, you could overcome this by making the website easy to read and colours that everyone can see. Also some people have epilepsy and you can avoid using flashing effects and videos but if you still want to include this type of content that could affect people with epilepsy you should use a warning. People can be hard of hearing or be completely deaf so you can use videos on the site that have subtitles so everyone can understand it.</p>
<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h3>
<p> There are alot of different file types you can use on websites,for photos and images you can use jpeg or gif which are image formats that should automatically appear on the web page. For text based formats you can use HTML you should be able to view these files in a text editor where you can read the text.for sound you can use mp3 which you can use for music or any sound you wish. For video you can use flv which is for the adobe flash player, you can also use webm which is for short video clips that are shown on the site.</p>
