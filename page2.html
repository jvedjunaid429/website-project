        <P>I will use a Trello board to plan out making my website which uses the kanban method. I will create tasks and put everything i need to do in a list so when I am doing the task I will move it into doing so that when it is completed i can put the task into done so that i know that it is completed. I have also added an extra list called review, so when i have completed the task I can have someone look at the task and give me feedback so that I know I have completed the task correctly or if i need to add some more or even change it completely to meet the criteria.</P>
        <H3>1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</H3>
        <P>A digital project can fail or be impacted by requirements of a digital project that can be unrealistic or you may not have the right tools or resources for the project and can even be because of poor planning and organization. The lack of communication between a team,bad or no organization, poor budget management could lead to failure. If there is a team working on a digital project together and I there is no management or leadership the project could be impacted because no one is overlooking the project and making sure tasks are completed in time.</P>
