 <h2>About me</h2>
 <p>My name is Junaid Javed. I am 21 years old, I'm from oldham. I have always been into IT, in college I studied hardware level 2 and I passed the course but hardware was not for me. I decided to come to Codenation to do a coding course so that I can be able to make my own websites and maybe even create a game. I also wanted to get into the software side instead of hardware. At Codenation I have already learned some python coding. I have completed a text based game on python with a group for under a week using what we had learned from Codenation.</p>
