        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h3>
        <p>I would research online and see what type of technology is used for the job that I am about to do, so that I have an idea of what technology and software that I can use. Then I will look at all the technology that I can use for my job and see which one is right for the job, I will  check the price of the IT system, the compatibility to me and the tools I already have. I also see the functionality, credibility,user friendliness and agility of the technology that i may get so that I know once I get it I won't regret my decision. </p>

        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h3>
        <p>Trello has helped me plan by allowing me to control the board so that I can set as many tasks as I like and put a deadline on them so that I can finish the tasks in time. I can add lists using the Kanban method, i'm using to-do , doing and done but i have also added review so that I can have someone overlook my project and tell me if i've made any mistakes or if I need to add something then after that I can put the tasks into done.<br>
            Git will help me by using version control which will keep track of my code and the changes that I make to it. So that if I want to fallback on a different version of my code I can use that instead of having to redo all my code again to fix an error. Github is a cloud based hosting service that will allow me to manage my projects that are using git. </p>
